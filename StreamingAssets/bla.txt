Time.unscaledTime

The timeScale-independant time at the beginning of this frame (Read Only). This is the time in seconds since the start of the game.
Returns the same value if called multiple times in a single frame. Unlike time this value is not affected by timeScale.

During Data saving we will use Time.unscaledTime as we want to have the real seconds. So all the entries in the Database, based on seconds will be unscaled! 


 Application.streamingAssetsPath , here will be the Database lol
